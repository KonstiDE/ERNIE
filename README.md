Welcome to the ERNIE repository. This repository will serve as a layer of presenting
my status on my internship in Sendai, (Japan :shinto_shrine: ), and deals with topic modeling pipelines and 
global media.

With a GDELT dataset, we try to analyse the interface of japanese media and internal crisis / event data to the 
international communities point of view.

Cheers, Caipi.
